Event Tracker
=============

This module has been implemented for a migration project with the purpose to
replace a BMC Event Manager installation. It therefore does not aim to be a
one-size-fits-all solution.

...serves the following purposes:

- provide a drop-in replacement for `msend`
- sync issues from SCOM
- sync objects from the Icinga IDO
- provide Hooks to allow to implement various kinds of back-channels

In said project, we used the following modules combined with this one:

- [BEM module](https://github.com/Thomas-Gelf/icingaweb2-module-bem): an
  integration with the **BMC (ProactiveNet) Event ManagerÂ©**. Originally used
  to send events to BMC, still in use to prove that EventTracker behaves the
  same way BMC used to work
- [iET module](https://github.com/Thomas-Gelf/icingaweb2-module-iet): hooks
  into various modules:
  - as an Import Source into Icinga Director
  - as Host/ServiceAction into the Monitoring module (to create tickets)
  - as an EventAction into the EventTracker, mainly to create Operational
    Requests

Purpose
-------

This module allows Operators to track Events from various sources in a single
place. It provides Hooks allowing Third-Party modules to trigger custom actions,
with Ticket/Issue-Creation being the most obvious use-case.

There are also hooks for a back-channel, providing information regarding created
tickets and acknowledged or resolved problems to various Event senders.

Configuration
-------------

To get this up and running, please:

* create a MySQL/MariaDB database
* apply the provided schema file in `schema/mysql.sql`
* define a related DB resource in Icinga Web 2

Now you're ready to populate `/etc/icingaweb2/modules/eventtracker/config.ini`:

### Refer the configured DB resource

```ini
[db]
resource = "Event Tracker"
```

### Eventually override default filter settings:

Per default, this module shows all problems starting from a `warning` level.
Filters are customizable in the UI, you can optionally customize the
default setting as follows:

```ini
[default-filters]
severity = emergency, alert, critical, error
```

## Eventually override default msend severity mappings:

```ini
[msend-severity-map]
MAJOR         = alert
CRITICAL      = critical
MINOR         = error
WARNING       = warning
INFORMATIONAL = informational
INFO          = informational
NORMAL        = informational
OK            = informational
```

### Synchronize custom variables from the IDO database

This module replicates available Icinga Object names from the IDO database, and
optionally also fetches Custom Variables. In case you need such, please define
then:

```ini
[ido-sync]
vars = location, priority
; Optionally look up hostnames with this domain:
; search_domain = example.com
```

### Force msend command logging

Forwarding msend-like parameters via HTTP might become tricky, that's why we
provide a script that behaves like `msend` in `contrib/msend-eventtracker`. In
case you need to wrap this in a custom script and face encoding issues, logging
every single command might help:

```ini
[msend]
force_log = yes
```

### Disable parts of the provided features

It might be desirable to disable some of the provided features. Currently this
is possible only for the part that deals with the `owner` of your issues:

```ini
[features]
disabled = owner
```

### SCOM integration

In case you want to periodically replicate issues from SCOM, please add a
dedicated section:

```ini
[scom]
db_resource = "MSSQL SCOM"
; simulation_file = /tmp/scomtest.json
; poll_interval = 5
; cmd_ticket_ref = "/usr/bin/ssh icinga@scom.example.com 'c:\\Scripts\\UpdateScomAlertTicketIdV1.ps1' '{sender_event_id}' '{ticket_ref}' '{owner}'"
; cmd_close = "/usr/bin/ssh icinga@scom.example.com 'c:\\Scripts\\ResetScomMonitorV3.ps1' '{sender_event_id}'"
```

You might want to enrich issues with custom attributes:

```ini
[scom_attributes]
my_SPECIAL = "https://wiki.example.com/RedirectPage.aspx?id=Windows-{rule_monitor_id:lower}"
```

Usually you want to fetch from the MSSQL database populated by SCOM, so please
provide a related `db_resource`. For testing reasons one might also want to use
a JSON-encoded file, that's what the `simulation_file` setting is for.

### Back-Channel to SCOM

You might want to automatically close issues in SCOM once they're being closed
in the EventTracker or to update a reference to created tickets when this module
creates such.
